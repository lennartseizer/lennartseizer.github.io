Psychology ~ Biology ~ Data Science

I am interested in solving challenging problems at the intersection of psychology and biology using intensive longitudinal data and time-series analysis to explore
- dynamic characteristics and time-variance of biopsychological variables and their covariance structures
- between- and within-person differences in psychoneuroimmunology what may drive such heterogeneity
- classification and forecasting tasks in psychiatry using time-series analysis
- conceptual and methodological improvement of ambulatory assessment approaches
