Psychology ~ Biology ~ Data Science

I am interested in solving challenging problems at the intersection of psychology and biology using intensive longitudinal data and time-series analysis to explore
- dynamic characteristics and time-variance of biopsychological variables and their covariance structures [[1](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2024.04.004),[2](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0290032)]
- between- and within-person variation and what may drive such heterogeneity [[3](https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14577)]
- classification and forecasting tasks in psychiatry using time-series analysis [[4](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2024.100733)]
- conceptual and methodological improvement of ambulatory assessment approaches [[5](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2024.04.039)]
